                China was the main contributor to the increase in global energy production, as its coal output grew for the first time after
                three years of reduction. Higher global energy prices spurred oil and gas production in the United States,
                after the 2016 drop. Energy production continued to decline in the European Union, owing to the moderate
                growth in energy consumption, lower primary electricity production (nuclear and hydro) the depletion of oil
                and gas resources and the climate policy that eventually implies the exit of coal. Large oil and gas exporting
                countries (Russia, Iran after the end of international sanctions, Canada or Nigeria to a lesser extent) as
                well as the fast-developing countries (India, Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil) have been the main contributors
                to the energy production increase in 2017. Conversely, Saudi Arabia's energy production was affected by the
                OPEC production cut agreement. Energy consumption remained stable in the United States for the second year
                in a row, partly due to a lower electricity demand and energy efficiency improvements. It recovered from
                two years of contraction in Brazil but declined in Mexico and Argentina. Energy consumption grew in most
                of Asian countries, such as India (steady growth rate since 2000), Indonesia, Malaysia or South Korea. It
                increased for the first time since 2013 in Japan, driven by the economic growth</h6>

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    30 November 2016 agreement between OPEC countries and some large non-OPEC producers to cut oil production to firm up global
                    prices translated into significant production cuts for Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE or Algeria, and
                    to a stable production in Russia. The agreement succeeded in raising global oil prices, which incited
                    non-OPEC countries such as the United States, Canada or Kazakhstan and OPEC countries exempted from cuts
                    such as Iran or Nigeria to raise production. The Iranian oil production rose by 1/3 between 2015 and
                    2017, thanks to the end of international sanctions. Conversely, crude oil production declined again in
                    China to its lowest level since 2009, as low prices in 2016 prompted producers to cut investment in oil
                    fields. Oil production in Latin America contracted for the third year in a row, due to falling production
                    in some large producing countries – oil output reached its lowest level since 1980 in Mexico and since
                    1990 in Venezuela – but it continued to increase in Brazil. Global energy consumption was spurred by
                    the rebound in China, the world’s largest energy consumer since 2009, triggered by the sustained economic
                    growth. Chinese energy consumption rose twice as fast as in 2016.</p>
